# Supercollider Client for Aporee.org

Radio Aporee Soundmap is a web based cartography for (field)recordings from all over the world, open to contributions. It contains field and location recordings from many different urban, rural, and natural environments.

Aporee also features an API that accepts geodata (latitude and longitude) and returns path to audio files that were recorded in close proximity to the given geodata. 

This library is based on [Freesound Client](https://github.com/g-roma/Freesound.sc)
